I'm building this site called the higher screen site, and what it does is, the concept is already stated in the PRD of this. So what it actually, I need is just a lot of like this page for like, remember the UX is specifically designed for like high-end, like HRs and stuff who actually get thousands of resumes a day and they need to scan it and use it to find the best candidates. So we are attaching a Gemini model to it. So what I need you to do is, I need you to generate, use Next.js, Tailwind, React, TypeScript, and NPM for the entire project. And I want, and initialize the project. And your task should make a homepage, should be extremely unique, very, very creative, but also very user-friendly. And like user experience should be perfect. And really push your limits of your design capabilities. And I need you to think out of the box here, ultra-think, make sure everything that you think about is already pushed to the maximum as to how you're going to plan this project out. Alright, once initialized, I need you to create five designs, five different designs, and each design will be very different, very creative in their own way, but they will be different from each other, whatever you create. And they should be hosted on slash 1, slash 2, slash 3, slash 4, slash 5. Create five designs, different, but each unique and impressive in their own way. Alright, remember, keep it good. Make sure they're beautiful. Use port brackets, insert port number here. Alright, and name it higher screen. Generate the icons, generate the main homepage, then also generate the, uh, make the homepage and make sure the colors and everything are all locked in and make sure they're all perfect, really clean, aesthetic, and beautiful. Alright, I'm attaching this prompt for you, like this, uh, I'm pushing this inside a .md file and I'm giving it to you. And in that file, there is a, uh, front-end design skill which I want you to use. I want you to follow it to the best of your abilities. Use it as much as you, like, use it and follow it as beautifully as possible and generate me these five, uh, what's it called, designs on, uh, hosted on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and I will choose the best one. Alright, so let's go with it. Ultra think and think well.

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
