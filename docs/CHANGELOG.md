All notable changes to the HireScreen project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-29

### 🚀 Initial MVP Release

The first production-ready release of HireScreen, capable of full end-to-end resume screening.

#### ✨ Features
- **AI Resume Screening:**
  - Upload multiple PDF resumes per job.
  - Ask natural language questions across all uploaded resumes.
  - Receive ranked answers with specific page citations.
- **Authentication:**
  - Secure Google OAuth integration.
  - Email/Password fallback.
  - Automatic profile creation on signup.
- **Dashboard:**
  - Job/Requisition management.
  - Usage tracking (queries used, resumes uploaded).
- **Subscription System:**
  - Integrated LemonSqueezy billing.
  - Free Tier (Limited usage).
  - Pro Tier (Unlimited/High volume).
- **Export:**
  - Export query results and candidate summaries to CSV.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **OpenAI Model:** Fixed critical issue where `gpt-4.1-nano` (invalid model) was being called. Switched to `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective, high-quality responses.
- **Authentication Redirects:** Fixed issue where Google Login would redirect to `localhost` in production. Now dynamically uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- **OAuth Error Handling:** Improved resilience of the callback route to handle provider errors (e.g., user cancellation) gracefully.

#### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Landing Page Animations:**
  - Added "Rolodex" vertical flip animation for the main headline ("by asking", "by thinking", "by searching").
  - Added "Typewriter" streaming text effect for the subheadline to mimic AI generation.
- **Visual Polish:**
  - Reduced excessive floating animations for a cleaner, more professional look.
  - Removed broken placeholder links (Privacy/Terms) from the footer.
  - Fixed mobile responsiveness issues in the hero section.
